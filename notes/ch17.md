# Chapter 17: Applicative

## Introduction

This is my notes from **Chapter 17: Applicative** of the book [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com).

## 17.1 Applicative

Applicatives are monoidal functors. Applicative involves monoids and functors. Applicative allows us to apply a function that exists inside a structure to a value that exists inside a structure.

## Defining Applicative

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Note that every type that has an Applicative instance must also have a Functor instance.

The infix function `<*>` is called `apply` or `ap`.

The `Control.Applicative` library provides the following convenient functions: `liftA`, `liftA2`, and `liftA3`:

```haskell
liftA :: Applicative f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

liftA2 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c

liftA3 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c -> d)
    ->  f a
    ->  f b
    ->  f c
    ->  f d
```

Note that `liftA` is the same as `fmap` but with Applicative constraint. `liftA2` and `liftA3` are `fmap` with functions involving more arguments.

## 17.3 Functor vs. Applicative

Any `Applicative` also has a `Functor`, so given an Applicative instance, we can define a Functor from it.

```haskell
import Control.Applicative

fmap f x = pure f <*> x
```

## 17.4 Applicative functors are monoidal functors

```haskell
($)   ::   (a -> b) ->   a ->   b -- function application with right associativity and lowest precedence.
(<$>) ::   (a -> b) -> f a -> f b -- fmap function
(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b -- apply function
```

## 17.5 Applicative in use

With list `Functor`, we map a sinngle function over a plurality of values. With the list `Applicative`, we map a plurality of functions over a plurality of values.
