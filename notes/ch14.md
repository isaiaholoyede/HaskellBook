# Chapter 14: Testing - Notes

## Introduction

This is my notes from **Chapter 14: Testing** of the book [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com).

## 14.1 Testing

Testing is a core part of the working programmer's toolkit.

## 14.2 A quick tour of testing for the uninitiated

Tests allow us to state an expectation and then verify that the result of an operation meets that expectation. There are two (2) broad categories of testing:
- Unit testing: Unit tests verifies or validates the smallest atomic units of software independently of one another. It checks that each function performs the task it is meant to do.
- Property testing: Property tests verifies or validates the formal properties of programs without requiring formal proofs by allowing us to express a truth-valued, universally quantified (something that applies to all cases) function - usually equality - which will then be checked against randomly generated values. Property test ensures we have met the minimum requirements to satisfy laws, such as the laws of monads or associativity. Property test is not useful for times when there are no assertable, truth-valued properties of the software.

## 14.3 Conventional testing

`:browse` is more useful when you are already familiar with a library and how it works. Use documentation when working with an unfamiliar library.

## 14.4 Enter QuickCheck

Property testing is done with the assertion of laws and properties. Hspec library is used for unit testing. 

QuickCheck library is used for property testing. ` QuickCheck` depends on a typeclass called `Arbitrary` and a `newtype` called `Gen` for generating its random data.

```haskell
Prelude> :t arbitrary
arbitrary :: Arbitrary a => Gen a
```

When you use the `arbitrary` value, you must specify the type to dispatch the right typeclass instance. 

Use `sample` and `sample'` from the `Test.QuickCheck` module to see some random data. `sample` prints each value on a new line. `sample'` returns the values in a list.

`Gen` is a newtype with a single type argument. It exists for wrapping up a function to generate pseudorandom values. Use `choose` and `elements` from the QuickCheck library for generating values. `choose` takes a tuple as its input. `elements` takes a list as its input.

## 14.5 Morse Code

When managing large projects, it can be useful to specify exports (what functions will get used by a module) to document your intent. 

`Data.Map` is a balanced binary tree, where each node is a pairing of a key and a value. The key is an index for the value. The key must be orderable (i.e. must have an `Ord` instance). Maps can be more efficient than lists because you perform binary search.

To use the test-suites:
- Use `stack ghci (your project name):(the test suite name)`. Enter `main` and your tests will run.
- Example:
- If your `.cabal` project file had the following values:

```
    name: ExampleProject
    ...
    test-suite Example-test
```    
then the command to run would be `stack ghci ExampleProject:Example-test`

## 14.6 Arbitrary instances

`CoArbitrary` is a counterpart to `Arbitrary`. `CoArbitrary` enables the generation of functions fitting a particular type.
