# Exercises: Tuple Experiment

```haskell
quotRem :: a -> a -> (a, a)
-- Given two integers, quotRem calculates their quotient and remainder and puts the results into a tuple.
divMod :: a -> a -> (a, a)
-- Given two integers. divMod calculates the integral division, truncated towards negative infinity and modulo and puts the results into a tuple.
```
