# Exercises: Find the Mistakes

```haskell
-- #1 not True && true
not True && True

-- #2 not (x = 6)
-- not (x == 6)
-- This will not compile because x is not defined.

-- #3 (1 * 2) > 5
(1 * 2) > 5

-- #4 [Merry] > [Happy]
["Merry"] > ["Happy"]

-- #5 [1, 2, 3] ++ "look at me!"
['1','2','3'] ++ "look at me!"

```
